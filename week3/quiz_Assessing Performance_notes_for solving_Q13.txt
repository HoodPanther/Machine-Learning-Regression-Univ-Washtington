Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data.

The coefficient of determination, denoted R2 or r2 and pronounced "R squared", is a number that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.
